\section{Personal background}
As part of a bachelor project at the Hasso Plattner Institute, the software solution `Noise to Opportunity` was developed by a group of 8 people within a year. `Noise to Opportunity` scans social media and analyzes the posts found. If these posts are associated with a company product and express a desire to buy, they are forwarded to salesmen, who are specialized on selling this product. I dealt with the data acquisition. Thus I have analyzed a large number of web sites in order to understand the registration-, login- and search processes. During this activity I noticed that most Internet forums have a similar structure. Initially, the challenge was to automatically log in the forum with a manually created user account and to search the forums. The analysis of the sites showed repetitive processes. The wish of an automatic registration emerged. Many registration forms have the same attribute names that identify them in the HTML source code. The registration process follows the same scheme and is therefore automatable just as logging in and searching. The idea arose to develop a program that can automatically index web content behind POST and GET forms of the Deep and Private Web. We saw the opportunity to make a prediction about how many posts about a particular product are available in a forum. Hence the thesis of this work, that it is possible to estimate how sales relevant the forum is for business products developed.
