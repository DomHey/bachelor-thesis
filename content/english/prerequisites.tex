\section{Prerequisites}
A forum has to be searchable in order to evaluate how relevant it is for a company.
A prerequisite for a programmatic search a forum is a successful login in the forum , either with an existing user account , or by an automatic registration and a login with the data you just created.
Logging into the forum is a necessity, in order do reveal the hidden content and make it accessable for the program. Therefore, the theory of a successful register, login and search of forum will be described in this chapter.

\subsection {Automatically register in forums}
To access the content of a forum you often have to create an useraccount first. Aufterwards you can log in with this account and see the protected content of the data.\\
Below are the steps described to enable an automated Register on websites. An overview of the registration process can be found in the appendix (Figure 20).

\subsubsection{Determination of the relevant forms in HTML web pages}
On the corresponding registration page of the respective Forum , an analysis is done on the HTML source of the page.
Each form tag is tracked form the website. A probability is calculated, that the found form element cointais all input elements for the registration process.\\
points will be awarded if the attributes of the form contain certain keywords like `Signup`, `User`, `Register` e.g.

These words have been generated by an analysis of  registration pages of 100 , randomly selected forums from the internet. For this purpose each registration form has been analyzed and the value of each `name` attribute stored. The following distribution was generated:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{3cm}|} \hline
Attributname & Anzahl \\ \hline
register & 53 \\ \hline
signup & 23 \\ \hline
usersignup & 7 \\ \hline
sign & 3 \\ \hline
u\_reg & 3 \\ \hline
reg & 2 \\ \hline
r & 1 \\ \hline
u & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Distribution of attribute names in registration forms in 100 forums}
\end{table}

In addition, the form must be wrapped in a POST form because the form must transmit entered information such as name, password and email in the POST body send with the registration attempt. Therefore you can rely on that if registration fields are availableon any website, they can be found in a POST form.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{ | p{5cm} | p{3cm}|} \hline
Registrierungsform & Anzahl \\ \hline
Post Formular & 89 \\ \hline
Javascriptfunktionen & 7 \\ \hline
keine Registrierung & 4 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Distribution of registration forms in 100 forums}
\end{table}

If the registration form is found, existing in input fields are analyzed and weighted in order to determine which field is most likely for user name , password and e-mail address. This classification is based on specific tags, similar to the classification POST forms of HTML web pages.
Thus, input fields that contain in their attributes words like ` login` , ` username` or `User` , are fields in which the user name has to be entered. A fixed value is added on top of the username score  for each occurance of these words. However if words like `Password` or `Email` occur a fixed value is added on top of the email or password score of the currently analyzed input field.

10 sites did not require entering a user name , but only an indication of an email.

\end{tabular}

5 websites did not require any indication of an email for registration.

Finally, the classificaion of the input field is based on the higest value of email-, password- and user name value. If all input fields are classified, all checkboxes are analyzed. These are meant to accept the board conditions, to stay logged in or to accept the newsletter of the particular forum. All checkboxes get checked. The newsletter does not annoy anyone because a spam email address is used for registering. \\
Finally, all input fields with hidden hinput fields are dissected. Hidden input fields have the attribute `hidden` in their HTML code.
These fields are meant to transmit additional data during the registering process and not meant to be edited by the user. Therefore the user can not fill in any information in hidden input fields because they are not visible on the website when rendered in the brwoser. They have to be transmitted because otherwise the parameters of the registration process would not be complete and the request invalid.

\subsubsection{Submit of the registration request}
With the prvious step, all relevant data have been collected for the registration process. Now, a random user name is generated. For this, the external service randomuser.me \footnote{http://api.randomuser.me/} is used. This services provides a valid email for 10 minutes. This email address is entered as value in each email input field.\\
Now all key-value pairs of the post body are valid of the registration request and the request can be sent.
